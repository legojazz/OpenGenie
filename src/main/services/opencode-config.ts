 * Keeps GenieEngine's entries in the user's global OpenCode config
 * (~/.config/opencode/opencode.json) up to date at app startup:
 *
 *  - `mcp.genieengine` — the game-testing MCP bridge, giving the assistant the
 *    run_game_test / game_input / game_screenshot / game_state tools in every
 *    project. The bridge is spawned with the app's own binary in Node mode
 *    (ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE), so users don't need Node installed; it locates
 *    the running app through harness.json (see test-harness.ts), so this
 *    config stays valid across app restarts. This file entry serves OpenCode
 *    sessions launched outside the app (e.g. a terminal); servers the app
 *    spawns get a per-spawn override pointing at their own instance instead
 *    (see genieengineMcpEntry).
 *  - `agent.image-reader` / `agent.game-tester` — the image-enabled subagents
 *    (see opencode-setup.ts). Re-applied here so users who never reopen the
 *    settings panel (upgrades) still get them, and so prompt/tool refinements
 *    ship with app updates. The models the user picked are preserved.
 *
 * Everything else in the config is the user's and is left untouched.

 * This instance's `mcp.genieengine` entry, pointing at its own binary and

 * broken install). Used twice:
 *
 *  - written into the global config below, as the fallback for OpenCode
 *    sessions not launched by the app;
 *  - passed per spawn via OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT (see ensureServer in
 *    opencode.ts). The global file names exactly ONE instance's paths
 *    (last-started wins), so with several installs around (dev checkout +
 *    mounted DMG builds) it points every other instance at a binary that
 *    instance's sandbox can't read — which silently killed the bridge and
 *    all game tools. The override keeps each server on its own bridge.
