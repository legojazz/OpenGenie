/**
 * Provider setup for the AI chat, which runs as a small agent team over
 * THREE configurable model slots:
 *
 *  - MEDIUM — the everyday chat/coding model. It is the default for chat
 *    messages and doubles as the global `model` in the OpenCode config, so
 *    OpenCode sessions started outside the app match the app's default.
 *  - LARGE — a heavyweight chat model for tough tasks; the user switches to
 *    it per-conversation from the chat box. Both chat models are named
 *    explicitly on every message the app sends (see sendChatMessage), which
 *    is what lets one conversation continue seamlessly across a switch.
 *  - IMAGE — the image-enabled model behind the two subagents declared under
 *    `agent` in the same config:
 *      · image-reader — describes image files (user-uploaded references,
 *        generated art) to the chat agent, which may not see images itself;
 *      · game-tester  — plays the game via the genieengine MCP tools and
 *        verifies the screenshots it takes.
 *
 * Every slot has its own endpoint + API key. Keys go into OpenCode's
 * credential store (auth.json, the same file `opencode auth login` writes);
 * endpoints + models go into the global OpenCode config. Chat slots on the
 * OpenRouter endpoint map to OpenCode's built-in `openrouter` provider
 * (keeping models.dev metadata like context limits and reasoning support);
 * chat slots on other endpoints get openai-compatible provider entries under
 * the STABLE ids `medium` / `large`.
 *
 * The image slot ALWAYS uses its own `image` provider entry — even on
 * OpenRouter, where the chat slots use the built-in provider. Earlier
 * versions derived the image slot's provider from a comparison with the chat
 * endpoint, which aliased both models onto one credential: updating the chat
 * key silently overwrote the image key, and changing the chat endpoint
 * stranded the image credential entirely. A fixed per-slot id makes that
 * impossible. "Leave the key blank to reuse the chat key" still works, but
 * as a COPY into the slot's own credential at save time, never as sharing.
